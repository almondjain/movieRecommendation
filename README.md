## About App
Nowadays, we all watched movie either use Netflix or Amazon Prime. We all have our genre and loved to watch based on that. 
Netflix, Amazon Prime and other use AI or some other tools at the backend to recommend a movie according to the user taste.

Here, I also tried to built Movie Recommendation App using basic tools like HTML, CSS and JS.

You will be provided list of genre, on the basis of selection of your genre list of movies will be recommended.

Isn't it cool?
